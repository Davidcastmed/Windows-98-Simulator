/* This is a workaround for a common issue with custom pipes in standalone components. 
   Angular sometimes needs an explicit CSS file, even if it's empty, for pipes to be recognized correctly.
   For sanitizing HTML, a proper pipe would be defined, but for this applet environment, we'll keep it simple
   and assume the SVG strings are safe. We'll use a simple binding for innerHTML.
*/
/* The pipe is not needed as we can bind directly to innerHTML.
   To avoid security risks in a real app, DOMSanitizer should be used.
   In this controlled environment, we can live without it for simplicity.
